I will be using quarterly data inputs for GDP growth and monthly for Consumer Confidence Index. This will mean in the future I will
have to adjust the monthly into quarterly averages.

**NOTE:** The GDP data only goes up to 2024 Q1. So I adjusted the monthly CCI data to accomodate.

**For CCI data, Composite leading indicators:**

--> Reference area: Australia

--> Frequency of observation: Monthly

--> Measure: Composite consumer confidence

--> Calculation methodology: OECD harmonised

--> Unit of measure: Index, Amplitude adjusted


**For GDP data, Composite leading indicators:**

--> Frequency of observation: Quarterly

--> Reference area: Australia

--> Combined transaction: Gross domestic product, Total economy

--> Combined unit of measure: Growth rate, period on period, Chain linked volume, Calendar and seasonally adjusted
