I will be using quarterly data inputs for GDP growth and monthly for Consumer Confidence Index. This will mean in the future I will
have to adjust the monthly into quarterly averages.

**For CCI data, Composite leading indicators:**
--> Reference area: Australia
--> Frequency of observation: Monthly
Measure: Composite consumer confidence
Calculation methodology: OECD harmonised
Unit of measure: Index, Amplitude adjusted
