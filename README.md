# Consumer-Confidence-GDP-Growth
Can we confidently use consumer confidence to predict GDP across distinct economies?

## 🔍 Project Goal
First test the significance of consumer confidence on short term GDP growth in Australia, and compare this relationship with a non-OECD developing country to identify structural differences in how sentiment impacts macroeconomic activity.

## 📊 Tools
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels
- GitHub for version tracking
- Power BI for final visualisation

## 🗂️ Structure
- `data/` → CSVs with quarterly data
- `notebooks/` → Analysis code
- `outputs/` → Charts and results
- `writeup.md` → Final summary
- `project-notes.md` → Research log and reflections
